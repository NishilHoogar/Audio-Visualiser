# 🎵 Audio File Player (GitHub Pages Hosted)

This is a **simple static website** that allows users to **upload and play audio files** directly in their browser. The site is hosted on **GitHub Pages** and works entirely on the client side using JavaScript.

## 🚀 Features
- Users can **upload an audio file** from their device.
- The file is played **instantly in the browser** without requiring a server.
- Works with **MP3, WAV, and other common audio formats**.

## 🔗 Live Demo
Check out the live site here: [Audio Visualiser](https://audioxvisualiser.netlify.app/)

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. Click on the **"Choose File"** button to select an audio file.
2. The selected file is loaded and played using JavaScript.
3. No data is uploaded or stored—everything runs locally in your browser.
